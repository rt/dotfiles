```text
:GDelete    git rm on current file and simultaneously deletes the buffer
:GMove      git mv on current file and changes the buffer name to match
:GRename    :GMove filename relative to the current file's directory
:Git commit
:GBrowse

use diffget(do)/diffput(dp) to patch parts of the working copy to the index (git diff --cached) will show the difference
sometimes vim gets confused in the diff highlighting, diffupdate will redraw
```
