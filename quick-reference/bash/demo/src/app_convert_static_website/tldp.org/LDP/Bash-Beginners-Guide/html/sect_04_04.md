===========================

Regular expressions are powerful tools for selecting particular lines
from files or output. A lot of UNIX commands use regular expressions:
**vim**, **perl**, the [PostgreSQL]{.application} database and so on.
They can be made available in any language or application using external
libraries, and they even found their way to non-UNIX systems. For
instance, regular expressions are used in the Excell spreadsheet that
comes with the MicroSoft Windows Office suite. In this chapter we got
the feel of the **grep** command, which is indispensable in any UNIX
environment.
