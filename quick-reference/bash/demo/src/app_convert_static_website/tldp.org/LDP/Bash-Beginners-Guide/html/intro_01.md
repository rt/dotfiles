[]{#intro_01}1. Why this guide? {#why-this-guide .section}
===============================

The primary reason for writing this document is that a lot of readers
feel the existing
[HOWTO](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.md) to be too
short and incomplete, while the [Bash
Scripting](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) guide is too much of a
reference work. There is nothing in between these two extremes. I also
wrote this guide on the general principal that not enough free basic
courses are available, though they should be.

This is a practical guide which, while not always being too serious,
tries to give real-life instead of theoretical examples. I partly wrote
it because I don\'t get excited with stripped down and over-simplified
examples written by people who know what they are talking about, showing
some really cool Bash feature so much out of its context that you cannot
ever use it in practical circumstances. You can read that sort of stuff
after finishing this book, which contains exercises and examples that
will help you survive in the real world.

From my experience as UNIX/Linux user, system administrator and trainer,
I know that people can have years of daily interaction with their
systems, without having the slightest knowledge of task automation. Thus
they often think that UNIX is not userfriendly, and even worse, they get
the impression that it is slow and old-fashioned. This problem is
another one that can be remedied by this guide.
