[]{#sect_02_02_01}2.2.1. Which shell will run the script? {#which-shell-will-run-the-script .sect2}
---------------------------------------------------------

When running a script in a subshell, you should define which shell
should run the script. The shell type in which you wrote the script
might not be the default on your system, so commands you entered might
result in errors when executed by the wrong shell.

The first line of the script determines the shell to start. The first
two characters of the first line should be *\#!*, then follows the path
to the shell that should interpret the commands that follow. Blank lines
are also considered to be lines, so don\'t start your script with an
empty line.

For the purpose of this course, all scripts will start with the line

**\#!/bin/bash**

As noted before, this implies that the Bash executable can be found in
`/bin`{.filename}.

[]{#sect_02_02_02}2.2.2. Adding comments {#adding-comments .sect2}
----------------------------------------

You should be aware of the fact that you might not be the only person
reading your code. A lot of users and system administrators run scripts
that were written by other people. If they want to see how you did it,
comments are useful to enlighten the reader.

Comments also make your own life easier. Say that you had to read a lot
of man pages in order to achieve a particular result with some command
that you used in your script. You won\'t remember how it worked if you
need to change your script after a few weeks or months, unless you have
commented what you did, how you did it and/or why you did it.

Take the `script1.sh`{.filename} example and copy it to
`commented-script1.sh`{.filename}, which we edit so that the comments
reflect what the script does. Everything the shell encounters after a
hash mark on a line is ignored and only visible upon opening the shell
script file:

In a decent script, the first lines are usually comment about what to
expect. Then each big chunk of commands will be commented as needed for
clarity\'s sake. Linux init scripts, as an example, in your system\'s
`init.d`{.filename} directory, are usually well commented since they
have to be readable and editable by everyone running Linux.
