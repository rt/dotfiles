`x(?=y)`	Lookahead assertion: 

Matches "x" only if "x" is followed by "y". For example, /Jack(?=Sprat)/
matches "Jack" only if it is followed by "Sprat".

/Jack(?=Sprat|Frost)/ matches "Jack" only if it is followed by "Sprat" or
"Frost". However, neither "Sprat" nor "Frost" is part of the match results.

`x(?!y)`	Negative lookahead assertion: 

matches "x" only if "x" is not followed by "y". For example, /\d+(?!\.)/
matches a number only if it is not followed by a decimal point.
/\d+(?!\.)/.exec('3.141') matches "141" but not "3".

`(?<=y)x`	Lookbehind assertion: 

Matches "x" only if "x" is preceded by "y". For example, /(?<=Jack)Sprat/
matches "Sprat" only if it is preceded by "Jack". /(?<=Jack|Tom)Sprat/ matches
"Sprat" only if it is preceded by "Jack" or "Tom". However, neither "Jack" nor
"Tom" is part of the match results.

`(?<!y)x`	Negative lookbehind assertion: 

Matches "x" only if "x" is not preceded by "y". For example, /(?<!-)\d+/
matches a number only if it is not preceded by a minus sign.
/(?<!-)\d+/.exec('3') matches "3". /(?<!-)\d+/.exec('-3')  match is not found
because the number is preceded by the minus sign.
