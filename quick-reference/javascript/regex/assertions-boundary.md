`^`	

Matches the beginning of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also
matches immediately after a line break character. For example, /^A/ does not
match the "A" in "an A", but does match the first "A" in "An A".

Note: This character has a different meaning when it appears at the start of a group.

`$`	

Matches the end of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches
immediately before a line break character. For example, /t$/ does not match the
"t" in "eater", but does match it in "eat".

`\b`	

Matches a word boundary. This is the position where a word character is not
followed or preceded by another word-character, such as between a letter and a
space. Note that a matched word boundary is not included in the match. In other
words, the length of a matched word boundary is zero.

Examples:

/\bm/ matches the "m" in "moon".
/oo\b/ does not match the "oo" in "moon", because "oo" is followed by "n" which is a word character.
/oon\b/ matches the "oon" in "moon", because "oon" is the end of the string, thus not followed by a word character.
/\w\b\w/ will never match anything, because a word character can never be followed by both a non-word and a word character.
To match a backspace character ([\b]), see Character Classes.

`\B`	

Matches a non-word boundary. This is a position where the previous and next
character are of the same type: Either both must be words, or both must be
non-words, for example between two letters or between two spaces. The beginning
and end of a string are considered non-words. Same as the matched word
boundary, the matched non-word boundary is also not included in the match. For
example, /\Bon/ matches "on" in "at noon", and /ye\B/ matches "ye" in "possibly
yesterday".
