>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
>high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
>object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
>together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting
>and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
