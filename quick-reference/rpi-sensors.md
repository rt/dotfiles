--Analog Hall    | Based on the Hall Effect, a Hall sensor is a one that varies its output voltage in response to a magnetic field.  Hall sensors are used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications.
--Auto-flash LED | Auto flash build-in colors on power on
--Avoidance      |
--Barometer      | Mesures atmosperic pressure.  Used in forecasting weather and determining altitude
--Flame          | Flame Sensor can be used to detect fire source or other light sources of the wavelength in the range of 760nm - 1100 nm
--Laser Emit
--Linear Hall    | Depending on the magnetic field, the output does not have a discrete switching state, but provides a signal proportional to the magnetic field strength.
--Reed Switch    | The reed switch (sometimes also known as Herkon) is an electrical switch operated by an applied magnetic field
--Shock          |
--Buzzer         |
--Light Blocking |
--Relay          | A relay is an electromagnetic switch operated by a relatively small electric current that can turn on or off a much larger electric current.
--SMD RGB        |
--Sound          | Big vs Small ?
--Rotary Encoder | also called a shaft encoder, is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to an analog or digital signal
--Tap
--Temp           | Digital and Analog
--Touch          |
--Tracking       | A tracking sensor has the same principle with an obstacle avoidance sensor (reflection) but has small transmitting power.
--Water Level    |
