# Quick Reference

Directory for simple reference lookups that can be triggered within terminal or vim.
fzf lookup with preview so files should be small (< 40 lines) but many of them. At

Prefer docker for simple
evaluation on a controlled env (change versions, etc). Use playground
for more in depths things.
