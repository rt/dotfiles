Registers in Vim let you run actions or commands on text stored within them. To
access a register, you type "a before a command, where a is the name of a
register. If you want to copy the current line into register k, you can type

  "kyy        
  "Kyy        :Or you can append to a register by using a capital letter
  "kp         :You can then move through the document and paste it elsewhere using
  :reg        :To access all currently defined registers type
