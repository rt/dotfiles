## To declaration and impl

Put cursor in symbol

### Java

- Use tags to go to declaration [R11], this brings you to the line of definition not the class name word
- When an interface, Search for similar file names as current file [R12], this brings you to the top of the file
- Use TagBar to jump you to the constructor [R02]

### JavaScript

- Use [R11] to go to declaration but it may make a mistake if there are multiple options. Use [R00] to select from options.


## Large File

- Use TabBar [R02] which will open to wherever you are in the file (use ctl-n/p to get to the constructor fast)
