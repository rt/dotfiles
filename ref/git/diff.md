# git-diff

**Vim**

Easiest to remember and most flexible to 

- `:vsp`
- `:Gedit branchname:%`
- `:windo diffthis`

**IntellJ**

In Project Structure either,

- If files are far apart, you can Compare With ...

- If files are close together, select both (LGUI) ... Compare

- There is also Compare with Clipboard if that is easier in some way
