## To declaration and impl

Put cursor in symbol

### Java

*IntelliJ*

- Use [R11] to go to a declaration
- Use [R12] to go to the impl (you can go direct from a symbol too)

*Vim*

- Use tags to go to declaration [R11], this brings you to the line of definition not the class name word
- When an interface, Search for similar file names as current file [R12], this brings you to the top of the file
- Use TagBar to jump you to the constructor [R02]

### JavaScript

*IntelliJ*

- Use [R11] to go to declaration, if there are more than one possibilities it'll show in a dropdown

*Vim*

- Use [R11] to go to declaration but it may make a mistake if there are multiple options. Use [R00] to select from options.



## Large File

*IntelliJ*

- Use File Structure [R02]
-

*Vim*

- Use TabBar [R02] which will open to wherever you are in the file (use ctl-n/p to get to the constructor fast)
