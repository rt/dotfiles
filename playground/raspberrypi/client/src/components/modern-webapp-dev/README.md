# Modern Web Application Development #

This is a repo for teaching course material for *Modern Web Development*.

### Goals

Though the program show what it takes to build an application properly in the cloud.  This answer's the common question of how much work does it take to build an app.  At the same time it focuses on how large companies do this to keep the application scalable and maintainable via rules on not only development but also process and roles.

The course is inteded to be colaborative and interactive, just as a company would develop.  Together we will develop real features and in the end see them deployed as a new version, real-time with rolling updates.

The course try's to provide the most commonly desired skills in the industry.  This project's technical stack is as follows.
* Javascript:  Javascript is the most popular programming language.  It can be use front-end and back-end and easily accomodate [Isomorphic Apps]() and most any architectual pattern.  You can find it being used for task scripts as well as for mobile native development.

## Notes

* Basic teaching patter is teach landscape/arch and give a topic to conquere.   see where they end up and compare to what you did.  That way, when working in that envirnment you solve a problem.
* Every week discuss a topic and have groups implement them where each person take turns being the committer.
* Every class can be follow along in a unit test environment.
* Build everything from scratch but have the "expected" repo for reference.  improvements can be added to the "expected"
* In the end, last courses version is replaced by the current.
*
* Show expected at the end so people compare and discuss
* User login is a great topic, complex (session, encryption) and much to add for the curious (captcha, facebook, ...)
