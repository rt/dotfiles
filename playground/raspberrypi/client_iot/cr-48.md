This is a special case for old chromebooks.

1. Get into developer mode (note this is different than getting shell with CTRL+ALT+T)
```
CTRL+ALT+=> 
```

2. Login as `chronos`  (no password needed)

3. Run
```
wget http://goo.gl/Fpi5C0; sudo bash Fpi5C0
```
You will be prompted for the size of the OS install (I did 7G for my 8G card ... not sure if that is right)
This will repartition the disk, take awhile then restart like a fresh install of chromeos.

4. Register/Login to chromeos, then do 1-3 again and all the files will download onto the disk.

According to the guy, you can only upgrade up until Ubuntu 14


5. Make ChrUbuntu the default
```
sudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -S 1 /dev/sda
```

or, make Chrome OS the default again
```
sudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 0 -S 1 /dev/sda
```


user/password:  "user/user"



6.  Reboot/Shutdown

To launch ubuntu at recovery screen when booting
```
CTRL-D
```




I ended up installing this over chromeOS (i didn't have the sd card in)
Its updated to 14.04 but SHOULD NOT go past that.  I uninstalled unity
and went for the lighter xfce4.

at splash screen
```
CTRL-D
```

```
startxfce4
```

will get the window environment.
