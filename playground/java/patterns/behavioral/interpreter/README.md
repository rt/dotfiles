# Interpreter

Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a
language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.

## Important Points

Interpreter pattern can be used when we can create a syntax tree for the
grammar we have.

Interpreter design pattern requires a lot of error checking and a lot of
expressions and code to evaluate them. It gets complicated when the grammar
becomes more complicated and hence hard to maintain and provide efficiency.

java.util.Pattern and subclasses of java.text.Format are some of the examples
of interpreter pattern used in JDK.
