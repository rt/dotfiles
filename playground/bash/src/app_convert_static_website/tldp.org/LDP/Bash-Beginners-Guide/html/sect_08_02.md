[]{#sect_08_02_01}8.2.1. Using the read built-in command {#using-the-read-built-in-command .sect2}
--------------------------------------------------------

The **read** built-in command is the counterpart of the **echo** and
**printf** commands. The syntax of the **read** command is as follows:

**read `[options]`{.option} `NAME1 NAME2 ... NAMEN`{.varname}**

One line is read from the standard input, or from the file descriptor
supplied as an argument to the `-u`{.option} option. The first word of
the line is assigned to the first name, `NAME1`{.varname}, the second
word to the second name, and so on, with leftover words and their
intervening separators assigned to the last name, `NAMEN`{.varname}. If
there are fewer words read from the input stream than there are names,
the remaining names are assigned empty values.

The characters in the value of the `IFS`{.varname} variable are used to
split the input line into words or tokens; see [Section
3.4.8](sect_03_04.md#sect_03_04_07). The backslash character may be
used to remove any special meaning for the next character read and for
line continuation.

If no names are supplied, the line read is assigned to the variable
`REPLY`{.varname}.

The return code of the **read** command is zero, unless an end-of-file
character is encountered, if **read** times out or if an invalid file
descriptor is supplied as the argument to the `-u`{.option} option.

The following options are supported by the Bash **read** built-in:

::: {.table}
[]{#tab_08_02}

**Table 8-2. Options to the read built-in**

  Option                   Meaning
  ------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -a `ANAME`{.varname}     The words are assigned to sequential indexes of the array variable `ANAME`{.varname}, starting at 0. All elements are removed from `ANAME`{.varname} before the assignment. Other `NAME`{.varname} arguments are ignored.
  -d `DELIM`{.varname}     The first character of `DELIM`{.varname} is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.
  -e                       **readline** is used to obtain the line.
  -n `NCHARS`{.varname}    **read** returns after reading `NCHARS`{.varname} characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input.
  -p `PROMPT`{.varname}    Display `PROMPT`{.varname}, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any input. The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
  -r                       If this option is given, backslash does not act as an escape character. The backslash is considered to be part of the line. In particular, a backslash-newline pair may not be used as a line continuation.
  -s                       Silent mode. If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.
  -t `TIMEOUT`{.varname}   Cause **read** to time out and return failure if a complete line of input is not read within `TIMEOUT`{.varname} seconds. This option has no effect if **read** is not reading input from the terminal or from a pipe.
  -u `FD`{.varname}        Read input from file descriptor `FD`{.varname}.

This is a straightforward example, improving on the
`leaptest.sh`{.filename} script from the previous chapter:

Of course, this situation is not ideal, since everybody can edit (but
not delete) Michel\'s files. You can solve this problem using special
access modes on the script file, see [SUID and
SGID](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_04_01.md#sect_04_01_06)
in the Introduction to Linux guide.

### []{#sect_08_02_03_01}8.2.3.1. General {#general .sect3}

As you know from basic shell usage, input and output of a command may be
redirected before it is executed, using a special notation - the
redirection operators - interpreted by the shell. Redirection may also
be used to open and close files for the current shell execution
environment.

Redirection can also occur in a script, so that it can receive input
from a file, for instance, or send output to a file. Later, the user can
review the output file, or it may be used by another script as input.

File input and output are accomplished by integer handles that track all
open files for a given process. These numeric values are known as file
descriptors. The best known file descriptors are *stdin*, *stdout* and
*stderr*, with file descriptor numbers 0, 1 and 2, respectively. These
numbers and respective devices are reserved. Bash can take TCP or UDP
ports on networked hosts as file descriptors as well.

The output below shows how the reserved file descriptors point to actual
devices:

Note that each process has its own view of the files under
`/proc/self`{.filename}, as it is actually a symbolic link to
`/proc/<process_ID>`{.filename}.

information about `/proc`{.filename} subdirectories and the way your
system handles standard file descriptors for each running process.

When excuting a given command, the following steps are excuted, in
order:

-   If the standard output of a previous command is being piped to the
    standard input of the current command, then
    `/proc/<current_process_ID>/fd/0`{.filename} is updated to target
    the same anonymous pipe as
    `/proc/<previous_process_ID/fd/1`{.filename}.

-   If the standard output of the current command is being piped to the
    standard input of the next command, then
    `/proc/<current_process_ID>/fd/1`{.filename} is updated to target
    another anonymous pipe.

-   Redirection for the current command is processed from left to right.

-   Redirection [\"N\>&M\"]{.QUOTE} or [\"N\<&M\"]{.QUOTE} after a
    command has the effect of creating or updating the symbolic link
    `/proc/self/fd/N`{.filename} with the same target as the symbolic
    link `/proc/self/fd/M`{.filename}.

-   The redirections [\"N\> file\"]{.QUOTE} and [\"N\< file\"]{.QUOTE}
    have the effect of creating or updating the symbolic link
    `/proc/self/fd/N`{.filename} with the target file.

-   File descriptor closure [\"N\>&-\"]{.QUOTE} has the effect of
    deleting the symbolic link `/proc/self/fd/N`{.filename}.

-   Only now is the current command executed.

When you run a script from the command line, nothing much changes
because the child shell process will use the same file descriptors as
the parent. When no such parent is available, for instance when you run
a script using the *cron* facility, the standard file descriptors are
pipes or other (temporary) files, unless some form of redirection is
used. This is demonstrated in the example below, which shows output from
a simple **at** script:

### []{#sect_08_02_03_02}8.2.3.2. Redirection of errors {#redirection-of-errors .sect3}

From the previous examples, it is clear that you can provide input and
output files for a script (see [Section
8.2.4](sect_08_02.md#sect_08_02_04) for more), but some tend to forget
about redirecting errors - output which might be depended upon later on.
Also, if you are lucky, errors will be mailed to you and eventual causes
of failure might get revealed. If you are not as lucky, errors will
cause your script to fail and won\'t be caught or sent anywhere, so that
you can\'t start to do any worthwhile debugging.

When redirecting errors, note that the order of precedence is
significant. For example, this command, issued in
`/var/spool`{.filename}

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| ls -l * 2> /var/tmp/unaccessible-in-spool                            |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

will redirect standard output of the **ls** command to the file
`unaccessible-in-spool`{.filename} in `/var/tmp`{.filename}. The command

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| ls -l * > /var/tmp/spoollist 2>&1                                    |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

will direct both standard input and standard error to the file
`spoollist`{.filename}. The command

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| ls -l * 2 >& 1 > /var/tmp/spoollist                                  |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

directs only the standard output to the destination file, because the
standard error is copied to standard output before the standard output
is redirected.

For convenience, errors are often redirected to `/dev/null`{.filename},
if it is sure they will not be needed. Hundreds of examples can be found
in the startup scripts for your system.

Bash allows for both standard output and standard error to be redirected
to the file whose name is the result of the expansion of
`FILE`{.filename} with this construct:

**&\> `FILE`{.filename}**

This is the equivalent of **\> `FILE`{.filename} 2\>&1**, the construct
used in the previous set of examples. It is also often combined with
redirection to `/dev/null`{.filename}, for instance when you just want a
command to execute, no matter what output or errors it gives.

### []{#sect_08_02_04_01}8.2.4.1. Using /dev/fd {#using-devfd .sect3}

The `/dev/fd`{.filename} directory contains entries named
`0`{.filename}, `1`{.filename}, `2`{.filename}, and so on. Opening the
file `/dev/fd/N`{.filename} is equivalent to duplicating file descriptor
*N*. If your system provides `/dev/stdin`{.filename},
`/dev/stdout`{.filename} and `/dev/stderr`{.filename}, you will see that
these are equivalent to `/dev/fd/0`{.filename}, `/dev/fd/1`{.filename}
and `/dev/fd/2`{.filename}, respectively.

The main use of the `/dev/fd`{.filename} files is from the shell. This
mechanism allows for programs that use pathname arguments to handle
standard input and standard output in the same way as other pathnames.
If `/dev/fd`{.filename} is not available on a system, you\'ll have to
find a way to bypass the problem. This can be done for instance using a
hyphen (*-*) to indicate that a program should read from a pipe. An
example:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| michel ~> filter body.txt.gz | cat header.txt - footer.txt           |

| e sysadmin                                                            |
| for setting us up such a great printing infrastructure.               |
|                                                                       |
| Text to be filtered.                                                  |
|                                                                       |
| This text is printed at the end of each print job.                    |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The **cat** command first reads the file `header.txt`{.filename}, next
its standard input which is the output of the **filter** command, and
last the `footer.txt`{.filename} file. The special meaning of the hyphen
as a command-line argument to refer to the standard input or standard
output is a misconception that has crept into many programs. There might
also be problems when specifying hyphen as the first argument, since it
might be interpreted as an option to the preceding command. Using
`/dev/fd`{.filename} allows for uniformity and prevents confusion:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| michel ~> filter body.txt | cat header.txt /dev/fd/0 footer.txt | lp |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In this clean example, all output is additionally piped through **lp**
to send it to the default printer.

#### []{#sect_08_02_04_02_01}8.2.4.2.1. Assigning file descriptors to files {#assigning-file-descriptors-to-files .sect4}

Another way of looking at file descriptors is thinking of them as a way
to assign a numeric value to a file. Instead of using the file name, you
can use the file descriptor number. The **exec** built-in command can be
used to replace the shell of the current process or to alter the file
descriptors of the current shell. For example, it can be used to assign
a file descriptor to a file. Use

**exec fdN\> `file`{.filename}**

for assigning file descriptor N to `file`{.filename} for output, and

**exec fdN\< `file`{.filename}**

for assigning file descriptor N to `file`{.filename} for input. After a
file descriptor has been assigned to a file, it can be used with the
shell redirection operators, as is demonstrated in the following
example:

### []{#sect_08_02_04_03}8.2.4.3. Closing file descriptors {#closing-file-descriptors .sect3}

Since child processes inherit open file descriptors, it is good practice
to close a file descriptor when it is no longer needed. This is done
using the

**exec fd\<&-**

syntax. In the above example, file descriptor 7, which has been assigned
to standard input, is closed each time the user needs to have access to
the actual standard input device, usually the keyboard.

The following is a simple example redirecting only standard error to a
pipe:

### []{#sect_08_02_04_04}8.2.4.4. *Here* documents {#here-documents .sect3}

Frequently, your script might call on another program or script that
requires input. The *here* document provides a way of instructing the
shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only
the search string is found (no trailing blanks). All of the lines read
up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command.

The result is that you don\'t need to call on separate files; you can
use shell-special characters, and it looks nicer than a bunch of
**echo**\'s:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Although we talk about a *here document*, it is supposed to be a
construct within the same script. This is an example that installs a
package automatically, eventhough you should normally confirm:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |

|                                                                       |
| # This script installs packages automatically, using yum.             |
|                                                                       |
| if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then                                                 |
|         echo "Usage: $0 package."                                     |
|         exit 1                                                        |
| fi                                                                    |
|                                                                       |
| yum install $1 << CONFIRM                                             |
| y                                                                     |
| CONFIRM                                                               |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

And this is how the script runs. When prompted with the [\"Is this ok
\[y/N\]\"]{.QUOTE} string, the script answers [\"y\"]{.QUOTE}
automatically:
