============================

Functions provide an easy way of grouping commands that you need to
execute repetitively. When a function is running, the positional
parameters are changed to those of the function. When it stops, they are
reset to those of the calling program. Functions are like mini-scripts,
and just like a script, they generate exit or return codes.

While this was a short chapter, it contains important knowledge needed
for achieving the ultimate state of laziness that is the typical goal of
any system administrator.
