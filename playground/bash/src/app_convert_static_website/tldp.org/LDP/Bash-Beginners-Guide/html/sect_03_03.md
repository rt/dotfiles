======================================

::: {.sect2}
[]{#sect_03_03_01}3.3.1. Why? {#why .sect2}
-----------------------------

A lot of keys have special meanings in some context or other. Quoting is
used to remove the special meaning of characters or words: quotes can
disable special treatment for special characters, they can prevent
reserved words from being recognized as such and they can disable
parameter expansion.

::: {.sect2}
[]{#sect_03_03_02}3.3.2. Escape characters {#escape-characters .sect2}
------------------------------------------

Escape characters are used to remove the special meaning from a single
character. A non-quoted backslash, \\, is used as an escape character in
Bash. It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows,
with the exception of *newline*. If a newline character appears
immediately after the backslash, it marks the continuation of a line
when it is longer that the width of the terminal; the backslash is
removed from the input stream and effectively ignored.

| franky ~> date=20021226                                              |
|                                                                       |
| franky ~> echo $date                                                  |
| 20021226                                                              |
|                                                                       |
| franky ~> echo \$date                                                 |
| $date                                                                 |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In this example, the variable `date`{.varname} is created and set to
hold a value. The first **echo** displays the value of the variable, but
for the second, the dollar sign is escaped.

[]{#sect_03_03_03}3.3.3. Single quotes {#single-quotes .sect2}
--------------------------------------

Single quotes (\'\') are used to preserve the literal value of each
character enclosed within the quotes. A single quote may not occur
between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.

We continue with the previous example:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| franky ~> echo '$date'                                               |
| $date                                                                 |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
:::

::: {.sect2}
[]{#sect_03_03_04}3.3.4. Double quotes {#double-quotes .sect2}
--------------------------------------

Using double quotes the literal value of all characters enclosed is
preserved, except for the dollar sign, the backticks (backward single
quotes, \`\`) and the backslash.

The dollar sign and the backticks retain their special meaning within
the double quotes.

The backslash retains its meaning only when followed by dollar,
backtick, double quote, backslash or newline. Within double quotes, the
backslashes are removed from the input stream when followed by one of
these characters. Backslashes preceding characters that don\'t have a
special meaning are left unmodified for processing by the shell
interpreter.

A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a
backslash.

::: {.sect2}
[]{#sect_03_03_05}3.3.5. ANSI-C quoting {#ansi-c-quoting .sect2}
---------------------------------------

Words in the form [\"\$\'STRING\'\"]{.QUOTE} are treated in a special
way. The word expands to a string, with backslash-escaped characters
replaced as specified by the ANSI-C standard. Backslash escape sequences
can be found in the Bash documentation.
:::

::: {.sect2}
[]{#sect_03_03_06}3.3.6. Locales {#locales .sect2}
--------------------------------

A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign will cause the string
to be translated according to the current locale. If the current locale
is [\"C\"]{.QUOTE} or [\"POSIX\"]{.QUOTE}, the dollar sign is ignored.
If the string is translated and replaced, the replacement is
double-quoted.
