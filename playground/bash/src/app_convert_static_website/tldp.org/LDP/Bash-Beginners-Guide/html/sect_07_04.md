===========================

In this chapter we learned how to build conditions into our scripts so
that different actions can be undertaken upon success or failure of a
command. The actions can be determined using the **if** statement. This
allows you to perform arithmetic and string comparisons, and testing of
exit code, input and files needed by the script.

A simple **if/then/fi** test often preceeds commands in a shell script
in order to prevent output generation, so that the script can easily be
run in the background or through the [cron]{.application} facility. More
complex definitions of conditions are usually put in a **case**
statement.

Upon successful condition testing, the script can explicitly inform the
parent using the **exit 0** status. Upon failure, any other number may
be returned. Based on the return code, the parent program can take
appropriate action.
