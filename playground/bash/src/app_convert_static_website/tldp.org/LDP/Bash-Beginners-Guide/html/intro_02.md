==========================================

Everybody working on a UNIX or UNIX-like system who wants to make life
easier on themselves, power users and sysadmins alike, can benefit from
reading this book. Readers who already have a grasp of working the
system using the command line will learn the ins and outs of shell
scripting that ease execution of daily tasks. System administration
relies a great deal on shell scripting; common tasks are often automated
using simple scripts. This document is full of examples that will
encourage you to write your own and that will inspire you to improve on
existing scripts.

-   You should be an experienced UNIX or Linux user, familiar with basic
    commands, man pages and documentation

-   Create users and groups, set passwords
