[]{#sect_01_02_01}1.2.1. Bash is the GNU shell {#bash-is-the-gnu-shell .sect2}
----------------------------------------------

The GNU project (GNU\'s Not UNIX) provides tools for UNIX-like system
administration which are free software and comply to UNIX standards.

Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from
the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the
IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers
functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive
use; these include command line editing, unlimited size command history,
job control, shell functions and aliases, indexed arrays of unlimited
size, and integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four. Bash
can run most sh scripts without modification.

Like the other GNU projects, the bash initiative was started to
preserve, protect and promote the freedom to use, study, copy, modify
and redistribute software. It is generally known that such conditions
stimulate creativity. This was also the case with the bash program,
which has a lot of extra features that other shells can\'t offer.

### []{#sect_01_02_02_01}1.2.2.1. Invocation {#invocation .sect3}

In addition to the single-character shell command line options which can
generally be configured using the **set** shell built-in command, there
are several multi-character options that you can use. We will come
across a couple of the more popular options in this and the following
chapters; the complete list can be found in the Bash info pages, [Bash
features]{.guimenu}-\>[Invoking Bash]{.guimenuitem}.
:::

::: {.sect3}
### []{#sect_01_02_02_02}1.2.2.2. Bash startup files {#bash-startup-files .sect3}

Startup files are scripts that are read and executed by Bash when it
starts. The following subsections describe different ways to start the
shell, and the startup files that are read consequently.

::: {.sect4}
#### []{#sect_01_02_02_02_01}1.2.2.2.1. Invoked as an interactive login shell, or with \`\--login\' {#invoked-as-an-interactive-login-shell-or-with---login .sect4}

Interactive means you can enter commands. The shell is not running
because a script has been activated. A login shell means that you got
the shell after authenticating to the system, usually by giving your
user name and password.

Files read:

-   `/etc/profile`{.filename}

-   `~/.bash_profile`{.filename}, `~/.bash_login`{.filename} or
    `~/.profile`{.filename}: first existing readable file is read

-   `~/.bash_logout`{.filename} upon logout.

Error messages are printed if configuration files exist but are not
readable. If a file does not exist, bash searches for the next.
:::

::: {.sect4}
#### []{#sect_01_02_02_02_02}1.2.2.2.2. Invoked as an interactive non-login shell {#invoked-as-an-interactive-non-login-shell .sect4}

A non-login shell means that you did not have to authenticate to the
system. For instance, when you open a terminal using an icon, or a menu
item, that is a non-login shell.

Files read:

-   `~/.bashrc`{.filename}

This file is usually referred to in `~/.bash_profile`{.filename}:

**if `[ -f ~/.bashrc`{.function} \]; then . `~/.bashrc`{.filename}; fi**

See [Chapter 7](chap_07.md) for more information on the **if**
construct.
:::

::: {.sect4}
#### []{#sect_01_02_02_02_03}1.2.2.2.3. Invoked non-interactively {#invoked-non-interactively .sect4}

All scripts use non-interactive shells. They are programmed to do
certain tasks and cannot be instructed to do other jobs than those for
which they are programmed.

Files read:

-   defined by `BASH_ENV`{.varname}

`PATH`{.varname} is not used to search for this file, so if you want to
use it, best refer to it by giving the full path and file name.
:::

::: {.sect4}
#### []{#sect_01_02_02_02_04}1.2.2.2.4. Invoked with the sh command {#invoked-with-the-sh-command .sect4}

Bash tries to behave as the historical Bourne **sh** program while
conforming to the POSIX standard as well.

Files read:

-   `/etc/profile`{.filename}

-   `~/.profile`{.filename}

When invoked interactively, the `ENV`{.varname} variable can point to
extra startup information.
:::

::: {.sect4}
#### []{#sect_01_02_02_02_05}1.2.2.2.5. POSIX mode {#posix-mode .sect4}

This option is enabled either using the **set** built-in:

**set `-o posix`{.option}**

or by calling the **bash** program with the `--posix`{.option} option.
Bash will then try to behave as compliant as possible to the POSIX
standard for shells. Setting the `POSIXLY_CORRECT`{.varname} variable
does the same.

Files read:

-   defined by `ENV`{.varname} variable.
:::

::: {.sect4}
#### []{#sect_01_02_02_02_06}1.2.2.2.6. Invoked remotely {#invoked-remotely .sect4}

Files read when invoked by **rshd**:

-   `~/.bashrc`{.filename}

::: {.sect4}
#### []{#sect_01_02_02_03_01}1.2.2.3.1. What is an interactive shell? {#what-is-an-interactive-shell .sect4}

An interactive shell generally reads from, and writes to, a user\'s
terminal: input and output are connected to a terminal. Bash interactive
behavior is started when the **bash** command is called upon without
non-option arguments, except when the option is a string to read from or
when the shell is invoked to read from standard input, which allows for
positional parameters to be set (see [Chapter 3](chap_03.md) ).

Test by looking at the content of the special parameter `-`{.varname},
it contains an \'i\' when the shell is interactive:

| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

In non-interactive shells, the prompt, `PS1`{.varname}, is unset.
:::

::: {.sect4}
#### []{#sect_01_02_02_03_03}1.2.2.3.3. Interactive shell behavior {#interactive-shell-behavior .sect4}

Differences in interactive mode:

-   Bash reads startup files.

-   Job control enabled by default.

-   Prompts are set, `PS2`{.varname} is enabled for multi-line commands,
    it is usually set to [\"\>\"]{.QUOTE}. This is also the prompt you
    get when the shell thinks you entered an unfinished command, for
    instance when you forget quotes, command structures that cannot be
    left out, etc.

-   Commands are by default read from the command line using
    **readline**.

-   Bash interprets the shell option `ignoreeof`{.option} instead of
    exiting immediately upon receiving EOF (End Of File).

-   Command history and history expansion are enabled by default.
    History is saved in the file pointed to by `HISTFILE`{.varname} when
    the shell exits. By default, `HISTFILE`{.varname} points to
    `~/.bash_history`{.filename}.

-   Alias expansion is enabled.

-   In the absence of traps, the `SIGTERM`{.option} signal is ignored.

-   In the absence of traps, `SIGINT`{.option} is caught and handled.
    Thus, typing **Ctrl**+**C**, for example, will not quit your
    interactive shell.

-   Sending `SIGHUP`{.option} signals to all jobs on exit is configured
    with the `huponexit`{.option} option.

-   Commands are executed upon read.

-   Bash checks for mail periodically.

-   Bash can be configured to exit when it encounters unreferenced
    variables. In interactive mode this behavior is disabled.

-   When shell built-in commands encounter redirection errors, this will
    not cause the shell to exit.

-   Special built-ins returning errors when used in POSIX mode don\'t
    cause the shell to exit. The built-in commands are listed in
    [Section 1.3.2](sect_01_03.md#sect_01_03_02).

-   Failure of **exec** will not exit the shell.

-   Parser syntax errors don\'t cause the shell to exit.

-   Simple spell check for the arguments to the **cd** built-in is
    enabled by default.

-   Automatic exit after the length of time specified in the
    `TMOUT`{.varname} variable has passed, is enabled.

-   [Section 3.6](sect_03_06.md)

-   See [Chapter 12](chap_12.md) for more about signals.

    performed upon entering a command.

### []{#sect_01_02_02_04}1.2.2.4. Conditionals {#conditionals .sect3}

Conditional expressions are used by the **\[\[** compound command and by
the **test** and **\[** built-in commands.

Expressions may be unary or binary. Unary expressions are often used to
examine the status of a file. You only need one object, for instance a
file, to do the operation on.

There are string operators and numeric comparison operators as well;
these are binary operators, requiring two objects to do the operation
on. If the `FILE`{.option} argument to one of the primaries is in the
form `/dev/fd/N`{.filename}, then file descriptor N is checked. If the
`FILE`{.option} argument to one of the primaries is one of
`/dev/stdin`{.filename}, `/dev/stdout`{.filename} or
`/dev/stderr`{.filename}, then file descriptor 0, 1 or 2 respectively is
checked.

Conditionals are discussed in detail in [Chapter 7](chap_07.md).

More information about the file descriptors in [Section
8.2.3](sect_08_02.md#sect_08_02_03).
:::

::: {.sect3}
### []{#sect_01_02_02_05}1.2.2.5. Shell arithmetic {#shell-arithmetic .sect3}

The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, as one of the
shell expansions or by the **let** built-in.

Evaluation is done in fixed-width integers with no check for overflow,
though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error. The operators
and their precedence and associativity are the same as in the C
language, see [Chapter 3](chap_03.md).
:::

::: {.sect3}
### []{#sect_01_02_02_06}1.2.2.6. Aliases {#aliases .sect3}

Aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as
the first word of a simple command. The shell maintains a list of
aliases that may be set and unset with the **alias** and **unalias**
commands.

Bash always reads at least one complete line of input before executing
any of the commands on that line. Aliases are expanded when a command is
read, not when it is executed. Therefore, an alias definition appearing
on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next
line of input is read. The commands following the alias definition on
that line are not affected by the new alias.

Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the
function is executed, because a function definition is itself a compound
command. As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not
available until after that function is executed.

We will discuss aliases in detail in [Section 3.5](sect_03_05.md).
:::

::: {.sect3}
### []{#sect_01_02_02_07}1.2.2.7. Arrays {#arrays .sect3}

Bash provides one-dimensional array variables. Any variable may be used
as an array; the **declare** built-in will explicitly declare an array.
There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement
that members be indexed or assigned contiguously. Arrays are zero-based.
See [Chapter 10](chap_10.md).
:::

::: {.sect3}
### []{#sect_01_02_02_08}1.2.2.8. Directory stack {#directory-stack .sect3}

The directory stack is a list of recently-visited directories. The
**pushd** built-in adds directories to the stack as it changes the
current directory, and the **popd** built-in removes specified
directories from the stack and changes the current directory to the
directory removed.

Content can be displayed issuing the **dirs** command or by checking the
content of the `DIRSTACK`{.varname} variable.

More information about the workings of this mechanism can be found in
the Bash info pages.
:::

::: {.sect3}
### []{#sect_01_02_02_09}1.2.2.9. The prompt {#the-prompt .sect3}

Bash makes playing with the prompt even more fun. See the section
*Controlling the Prompt* in the Bash info pages.
:::

::: {.sect3}
### []{#sect_01_02_02_10}1.2.2.10. The restricted shell {#the-restricted-shell .sect3}

When invoked as **rbash** or with the `--restricted`{.option} or
`-r`{.option} option, the following happens:

-   The **cd** built-in is disabled.

-   Setting or unsetting `SHELL`{.varname}, `PATH`{.varname},
    `ENV`{.varname} or `BASH_ENV`{.varname} is not possible.

-   Command names can no longer contain slashes.

-   Filenames containing a slash are not allowed with the **.**
    (**source**) built-in command.

-   The **hash** built-in does not accept slashes with the `-p`{.option}
    option.

-   Import of functions at startup is disabled.

-   `SHELLOPTS`{.varname} is ignored at startup.

-   Output redirection using **\>**, **\>\|**, **\>\<**, **\>&**,
    **&\>** and **\>\>** is disabled.

-   The **exec** built-in is disabled.

-   The `-f`{.option} and `-d`{.option} options are disabled for the
    **enable** built-in.

-   A default `PATH`{.varname} cannot be specified with the **command**
    built-in.

-   Turning off restricted mode is not possible.

When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed, **rbash**
turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.
