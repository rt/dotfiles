==============================

Here are some useful things you can do using functions:

1.  Add a function to your `~/.bashrc`{.filename} config file that
    automates the printing of man pages. The result should be that you
    type something like **printman \<command\>**, upon which the first
    appropriate man page rolls out of your printer. Check using a pseudo
    printer device for testing purposes.

    As an extra, build in a possibility for the user to supply the
    section number of the man page he or she wants to print.

2.  Create a subdirectory in your home directory in which you can store
    function definitions. Put a couple of functions in that directory.
    Useful functions might be, amongs others, that you have the same
    commands as on DOS or a commercial UNIX when working with Linux, or
    vice versa. These functions should then be imported in your shell
    environment when `~/.bashrc`{.filename} is read.
