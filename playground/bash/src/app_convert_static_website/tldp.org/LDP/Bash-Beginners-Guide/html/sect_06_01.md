[Gawk]{.application} is the GNU version of the commonly available UNIX
**awk** program, another popular stream editor. Since the **awk**
program is often just a link to **gawk**, we will refer to it as
**awk**.

The basic function of **awk** is to search files for lines or other text
units containing one or more patterns. When a line matches one of the
patterns, special actions are performed on that line.

Programs in **awk** are different from programs in most other languages,
because **awk** programs are [\"data-driven\"]{.QUOTE}: you describe the
data you want to work with and then what to do when you find it. Most
other languages are [\"procedural.\"]{.QUOTE} You have to describe, in
great detail, every step the program is to take. When working with
procedural languages, it is usually much harder to clearly describe the
data your program will process. For this reason, **awk** programs are
often refreshingly easy to read and write.

--------------------------------------

When you run **awk**, you specify an **awk** *program* that tells
**awk** what to do. The program consists of a series of *rules*. (It may
also contain function definitions, loops, conditions and other
programming constructs, advanced features that we will ignore for now.)
Each rule specifies one pattern to search for and one action to perform
upon finding the pattern.

There are several ways to run **awk**. If the program is short, it is
easiest to run it on the command line:

**awk PROGRAM `inputfile(s)`{.filename}**

If multiple changes have to be made, possibly regularly and on multiple
files, it is easier to put the **awk** commands in a script. This is
read like this:

**awk `-f`{.option} `PROGRAM-FILE`{.filename}
`inputfile(s)`{.filename}**
