==================================

::: {.sect2}
[]{#sect_09_02_01}9.2.1. What is it? {#what-is-it .sect2}
------------------------------------

The **while** construct allows for repetitive execution of a list of
commands, as long as the command controlling the **while** loop executes
successfully (exit status of zero). The syntax is:

**while CONTROL-COMMAND; do CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS; done**

**CONTROL-COMMAND** can be any command(s) that can exit with a success
or failure status. The **CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS** can be any program,
script or shell construct.

As soon as the **CONTROL-COMMAND** fails, the loop exits. In a script,
the command following the **done** statement is executed.

The return status is the exit status of the last **CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS**
command, or zero if none was executed.

### []{#sect_09_02_02_02}9.2.2.2. Nested while loops {#nested-while-loops .sect3}

The example below was written to copy pictures that are made with a
webcam to a web directory. Every five minutes a picture is taken. Every
hour, a new directory is created, holding the images for that hour.
Every day, a new directory is created containing 24 subdirectories. The
script runs in the background.

Note the use of the **true** statement. This means: continue execution
until we are forcibly interrupted (with **kill** or **Ctrl**+**C**).

This small script can be used for simulation testing; it generates
files:

| # This generates a file every 5 minutes                               |
|                                                                       |
