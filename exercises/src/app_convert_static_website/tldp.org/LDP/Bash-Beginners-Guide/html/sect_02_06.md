=============================

This exercise will help you to create your first script.

1.  Write a script using your favorite editor. The script should display
    the path to your homedirectory and the terminal type that you are
    using. Additionally it shows all the services started up in runlevel
    3 on your system. (hint: use `HOME`{.varname}, `TERM`{.varname} and
    **ls `/etc/rc3.d/S*`{.filename}**)

2.  Add comments in your script.

3.  Add information for the users of your script.

4.  Change permissions on your script so that you can run it.

5.  Run the script in normal mode and in debug mode. It should run
    without errors.

6.  Make errors in your script: see what happens if you misspell
    commands, if you leave out the first line or put something
    unintelligible there, or if you misspell shell variable names or
    write them in lower case characters after they have been declared in
    capitals. Check what the debug comments say about this.
