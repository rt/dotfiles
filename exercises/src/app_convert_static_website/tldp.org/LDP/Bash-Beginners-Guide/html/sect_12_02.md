---------------------------------

There might be situations when you don\'t want users of your scripts to
exit untimely using keyboard abort sequences, for example because input
has to be provided or cleanup has to be done. The **trap** statement
catches these sequences and can be programmed to execute a list of
commands upon catching those signals.

The syntax for the **trap** statement is straightforward:

**trap \[COMMANDS\] \[SIGNALS\]**

This instructs the **trap** command to catch the listed *SIGNALS*, which
may be signal names with or without the *SIG* prefix, or signal numbers.
If a signal is *0* or *EXIT*, the **COMMANDS** are executed when the
shell exits. If one of the signals is *DEBUG*, the list of **COMMANDS**
is executed after every simple command. A signal may also be specified
as *ERR*; in that case **COMMANDS** are executed each time a simple
command exits with a non-zero status. Note that these commands will not
be executed when the non-zero exit status comes from part of an **if**
statement, or from a **while** or **until** loop. Neither will they be
executed if a logical *AND* (&&) or *OR* (\|\|) result in a non-zero
exit code, or when a command\'s return status is inverted using the *!*
operator.

The return status of the **trap** command itself is zero unless an
invalid signal specification is encountered. The **trap** command takes
a couple of options, which are documented in the Bash info pages.

Here is a very simple example, catching **Ctrl**+**C** from the user,
upon which a message is printed. When you try to kill this program
without specifying the *KILL* signal, nothing will happen:

[]{#sect_12_02_02}12.2.2. How Bash interprets traps {#how-bash-interprets-traps .sect2}
---------------------------------------------------

When Bash receives a signal for which a trap has been set while waiting
for a command to complete, the trap will not be executed until the
command completes. When Bash is waiting for an asynchronous command via
the **wait** built-in, the reception of a signal for which a trap has
been set will cause the **wait** built-in to return immediately with an
exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is
executed.

### []{#sect_12_02_03_01}12.2.3.1. Detecting when a variable is used {#detecting-when-a-variable-is-used .sect3}

When debugging longer scripts, you might want to give a variable the
*trace* attribute and trap *DEBUG* messages for that variable. Normally
you would just declare a variable using an assignment like
**`VARIABLE`{.varname}=value**. Replacing the declaration of the
variable with the following lines might provide valuable information
about what your script is doing:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| declare -t VARIABLE=value                                            |
|                                                                       |
| trap "echo VARIABLE is being used here." DEBUG                        |
|                                                                       |
| # rest of the script                                                  |
| ```                                                                   |

### []{#sect_12_02_03_02}12.2.3.2. Removing rubbish upon exit {#removing-rubbish-upon-exit .sect3}

The **whatis** command relies on a database which is regularly built
using the `makewhatis.cron`{.filename} script with cron:
