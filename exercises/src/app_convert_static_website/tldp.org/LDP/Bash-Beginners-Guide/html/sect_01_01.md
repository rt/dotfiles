The UNIX shell program interprets user commands, which are either
directly entered by the user, or which can be read from a file called
the shell script or shell program. Shell scripts are interpreted, not
compiled. The shell reads commands from the script line per line and
searches for those commands on the system (see [Section
1.2](sect_01_02.md)), while a compiler converts a program into machine
readable form, an executable file - which may then be used in a shell
script.

Apart from passing commands to the kernel, the main task of a shell is
providing a user environment, which can be configured individually using
shell resource configuration files.

[]{#sect_01_01_02}1.1.2. Shell types {#shell-types .sect2}
------------------------------------

Just like people know different languages and dialects, your UNIX system
will usually offer a variety of shell types:

-   **sh** or Bourne Shell: the original shell still used on UNIX
    systems and in UNIX-related environments. This is the basic shell, a
    small program with few features. While this is not the standard
    shell, it is still available on every Linux system for compatibility
    with UNIX programs.

-   **bash** or Bourne Again shell: the standard GNU shell, intuitive
    and flexible. Probably most advisable for beginning users while
    being at the same time a powerful tool for the advanced and
    professional user. On Linux, **bash** is the standard shell for
    common users. This shell is a so-called *superset* of the Bourne
    shell, a set of add-ons and plug-ins. This means that the Bourne
    Again shell is compatible with the Bourne shell: commands that work
    in **sh**, also work in **bash**. However, the reverse is not always
    the case. All examples and exercises in this book use **bash**.

-   **csh** or C shell: the syntax of this shell resembles that of the C
    programming language. Sometimes asked for by programmers.

-   **tcsh** or TENEX C shell: a superset of the common C shell,
    enhancing user-friendliness and speed. That is why some also call it
    the Turbo C shell.

-   **ksh** or the Korn shell: sometimes appreciated by people with a
    UNIX background. A superset of the Bourne shell; with standard
    configuration a nightmare for beginning users.

The file `/etc/shells`{.filename} gives an overview of known shells on a
Linux system:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| mia:~> cat /etc/shells                                               |
| /bin/bash                                                             |
| /bin/sh                                                               |
| /bin/tcsh                                                             |
| /bin/csh                                                              |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Your default shell is set in the `/etc/passwd`{.filename} file, like
this line for user *mia*:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| mia:L2NOfqdlPrHwE:504:504:Mia Maya:/home/mia:/bin/bash               |
| ```                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

To switch from one shell to another, just enter the name of the new
shell in the active terminal. The system finds the directory where the
name occurs using the `PATH`{.varname} settings, and since a shell is an
executable file (program), the current shell activates it and it gets
executed. A new prompt is usually shown, because each shell has its
typical appearance:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``` {.screen}                                                         |
| mia:~> tcsh                                                          |
| [mia@post21 ~]$                                                       |
| ```                                                                   |
