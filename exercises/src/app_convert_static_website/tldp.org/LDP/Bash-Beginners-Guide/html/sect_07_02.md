commands test true, and another if it tests false. An example:

Like the **CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS** list following the **then** statement,
the **ALTERNATE-CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS** list following the **else**
statement can hold any UNIX-style command that returns an exit status.

Another example, extending the one from [Section
7.1.2.1](sect_07_01.md#sect_07_01_02_01):

We switch to the *root* account to demonstrate the effect of the
**else** statement - your *root* is usually a local account while your
own user account might be managed by a central system, such as an LDAP
server.

### []{#sect_07_02_01_02}7.2.1.2. Checking command line arguments {#checking-command-line-arguments .sect3}

Instead of setting a variable and then executing a script, it is
frequently more elegant to put the values for the variables on the
command line.

We use the positional parameters `$1`{.varname}, `$2`{.varname}, \...,
`$N`{.varname} for this purpose. `$#`{.varname} refers to the number of
command line arguments. `$0`{.varname} refers to the name of the script.

The following is a simple example:

::: {.figure}
[]{#AEN5029}

Note that the file is referred to using a variable; in this case it is
the first argument to the script. Alternatively, when no arguments are
given, file locations are usually stored in variables at the beginning
of a script, and their content is referred to using these variables.
Thus, when you want to change a file name in a script, you only need to
do it once.

This is the full form of the **if** statement:

**if TEST-COMMANDS; then**

**CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS;**

**elif MORE-TEST-COMMANDS; then**

**MORE-CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS;**

**else ALTERNATE-CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS;**

**fi**

The **TEST-COMMANDS** list is executed, and if its return status is
zero, the **CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS** list is executed. If **TEST-COMMANDS**
returns a non-zero status, each **elif** list is executed in turn, and
if its exit status is zero, the corresponding
**MORE-CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS** is executed and the command completes. If
**else** is followed by an **ALTERNATE-CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS** list, and
the final command in the final **if** or **elif** clause has a non-zero
exit status, then **ALTERNATE-CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS** is executed. The
return status is the exit status of the last command executed, or zero
if no condition tested true.

We use the double brackets for testing an arithmetic expression, see
[Section 3.4.6](sect_03_04.md#sect_03_04_05). This is equivalent to
the **let** statement. You will get stuck using square brackets here, if
you try something like **\$\[\$year % 400\]**, because here, the square
brackets don\'t represent an actual command by themselves.

Among other editors, **gvim** is one of those supporting colour schemes
according to the file format; such editors are useful for detecting
errors in your code.

[]{#sect_07_02_05}7.2.5. Using the exit statement and if {#using-the-exit-statement-and-if .sect2}
--------------------------------------------------------

We already briefly met the **exit** statement in [Section
7.2.1.3](sect_07_02.md#sect_07_02_01_03). It terminates execution of
the entire script. It is most often used if the input requested from the
user is incorrect, if a statement did not run successfully or if some
other error occurred.

The **exit** statement takes an optional argument. This argument is the
integer exit status code, which is passed back to the parent and stored
in the `$?`{.varname} variable.

A zero argument means that the script ran successfully. Any other value
may be used by programmers to pass back different messages to the
parent, so that different actions can be taken according to failure or
success of the child process. If no argument is given to the **exit**
command, the parent shell uses the current value of the `$?`{.varname}
variable.

Below is an example with a slightly adapted `penguin.sh`{.filename}
script, which sends its exit status back to the parent,
`feed.sh`{.filename}:
