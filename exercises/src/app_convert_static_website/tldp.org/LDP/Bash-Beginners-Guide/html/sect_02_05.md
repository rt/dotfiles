===========================

A shell script is a reusable series of commands put in an executable
text file. Any text editor can be used to write scripts.

Scripts start with *\#!* followed by the path to the shell executing the
commands from the script. Comments are added to a script for your own
future reference, and also to make it understandable for other users. It
is better to have too many explanations than not enough.

Debugging a script can be done using shell options. Shell options can be
used for partial debugging or for analyzing the entire script. Inserting
**echo** commands at strategic locations is also a common
troubleshooting technique.
