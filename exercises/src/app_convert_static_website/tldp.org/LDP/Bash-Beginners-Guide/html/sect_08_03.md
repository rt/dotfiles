===========================

In this chapter, we learned how to provide user comments and how to
prompt for user input. This is usually done using the **echo**/**read**
combination. We also discussed how files can be used as input and output
using file descriptors and redirection, and how this can be combined
with getting input from the user.

We stressed the importance of providing ample message for the users of
our scripts. As always when others use your scripts, it is better to
give too much information than not enough. *Here* documents is a type of
shell construct that allows creation of lists, holding choices for the
users. This construct can also be used to execute otherwise interactive
tasks in the background, without intervention.
